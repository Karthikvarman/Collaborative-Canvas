This project is a collaborative drawing board that allows multiple users to collaboratively draw on a single canvas, in real time. The application is built on HTML Canvas and plain JavaScript on the client side, with a Node.js and Socket.io server. When one user draws, all other users will see the drawing happen instantly. The application incorporates some basic tools, such as brush, eraser, colors, stroke size, and a shared undo/redo tool. To view the application, first install the dependencies using "npm install," then start the server with "npm run start," and finally visit "http://localhost:3000". Open in multiple tabs to see the collaborative live view!
